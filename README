I am creating a collection of thread related classes by having
everything declared and defined in the thread.h file.  As a result,
there is no library to be linked.  The application simply includes the
thread.h file and be done with it.

Still, if one wants to test before using it, one can always run:

    $ make check

Comments, questions and pull requests are equally welcome.
